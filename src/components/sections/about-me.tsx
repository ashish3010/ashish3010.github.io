            Curious about me? Here you have it:
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            I'm a passionate frontend developer with 4 years of experience building fast, accessible, and visually polished web and mobile applications. I specialize in technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, React Native, and TailwindCSS, with a strong focus on responsive UI, performance, and scalable architecture. I care deeply about user experience, clean design, and writing clear, maintainable code.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Currently, I work as a Software Development Engineer at Jio, where I actively contribute to key products like the MyJio app and the JioOnePay payment page. I started my professional journey in 2021 at Cognizant Technology Solutions, where I built a strong foundation in frontend development and industry practices.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Though I have foundational knowledge of backend tools like Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, my true strength lies in frontend engineeringâ€”bringing interfaces to life with precision, performance, and attention to detail.
          </Typography>
          <Typography>
            Outside of work, I enjoy reading tech blogs, exploring new frontend tools, and staying updated with the evolving web ecosystem. I'm also active on platforms like Twitter and Indie Hackers, where I follow early-stage startup journeys and engage with the dev community. While I'm not a freelancer, I'm open to collaborating on interesting projects that align with my skills and interests.
          </Typography>
